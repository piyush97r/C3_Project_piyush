Today, when the information technology is expanding vastly, these types of systems are required where users can gain knowledge on multiple aspects without having any fear.

Code Crackers is a free platform for Learning anytime anywhere.

Code Crackers is something required by every community, class, domain or locality of people. 

It helps people learn different types of skills. The system can be used by Students, Companies, Doctors, Laborerâ€™s, scientist etc.

People can get hired working on this website as their skills improve and reputed companies today look for skills and knowledge, not just certificates. 

The chances of people getting a job here is high because they are answering questions or working on something of their interests. As its always said, choose something for a career which you love to do. Code Crackers is made keeping this concept in mind.
Monthly Tests can be done for the users to improve their skills on particular domain. Companies can hire people based on these test results.

More Job Opportunities will be available through this website. Personal Tutors can be an advanced future enhancement of this Project.

Retired Teachers/Doctors etc. can spend their time answering questions to young achievers.
Artificial Intelligence can be added to this project later on to avoid the users answering same question multiple times. 

The system can be developed to consider the keywords that are offensive and directly remove it from the directory.
