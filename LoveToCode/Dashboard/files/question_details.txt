To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.<br/>
You've got this!#
A single line of text denoting inputString(the variable whose contents must be printed).#
Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of input string on the second line.#
Welcome to 30 Days of Code!.#
Hello, World.<br/>
Welcome to 30 Days of Code.#

Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements. #
The first line contains an integer,n, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains space-separated integers representing the array's elements.#
Print the sum of the array.#

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.<br/>
We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet A = (a[0],a[1],a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet B = (b[0],b[1],b[2]).<br/><br/>
Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], b[1] with a[1], and a[2] with b[2].<br /><br/>

    If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded point.<br/>
    If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded point.<br/>
    If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.<br/>
<br/>
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.<br/>

Given and A,B can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?#
The first line contains 3 space-separated integers describing the respective values in triplet A.<br/>
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers describing the respective values in triplet B.#
Print two space-separated integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob.#

Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.#
The first line of the input consists of an integer n.<br/>
The next line contains n space-separated integers contained in the array.#
Print the sum of the array elements.#
